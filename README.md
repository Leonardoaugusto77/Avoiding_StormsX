# Avoiding_Storms Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Avoiding_Storms project! This project was developed with the idea of helping users check the weather conditions of various locations by searching for the city name, allowing them to avoid localized storms. Additionally, users can search for cities based on their postal codes. Whether you're on your smartphone or computer, you can easily access this project using the provided [Project](https://avoiding-stroms-leonardoaugusto77.vercel.app/)

## About the Project

Before diving into the development, I created a navigable [Prototype](<https://www.figma.com/file/IFOZsy4QXZcaG2uPRdxnYe/Front_end(Teste)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=qixEvn5kGALeUBbh-1>) to visualize the final product. With over two years of experience in UX and UI Design, I've worked with various companies in Curitiba and beyond, utilizing these skills to enhance the project's user experience.

Through your automatic location, the weather search input is automatically updated with your city, allowing you to see real-time weather conditions.

## Improvements

Here are some improvements that could be added to the project with more time:

- Implement a more polished loading skeleton to enhance the waiting experience.

- Refactor functions and styles for better optimization.

- Integrate Redux or similar state management to enhance state handling.

- Seek enhancements in UX design, with a focus on accessibility for individuals with auditory and visual impairments.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project! Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated.

## Resources used

- **API CEP**: [Link da API](https://viacep.com.br/)

- **API OpenWeather**: [Link da API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

- **Styled Components**: Library for styling React components.

- **Design System**: I created a global style and a theme.ts file to store certain colors and patterns, showcasing my ability to work with this type of organization.

- **TypeScript Documentation**: I referred to the official TypeScript documentation to resolve queries and enhance my understanding of the language.

-- **React Router Dom**: I used the react router dom to create a back and forth navigation for the contact form

- **ChatGPT**: I utilized ChatGPT to research and clarify doubts related to TypeScript.

## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges during this project was my recent introduction to TypeScript, which I had started learning just a week before. Adjusting to the way props are treated and imported presented a learning curve, but with dedicated research, I was able to overcome these obstacles.

## Features

This project incorporates Axios to efficiently import data from APIs, providing versatility and up-to-date information. The use of styled-components streamlines the process of maintaining and organizing distinct styles for each component.

## Future Outlook

In five years, I envision myself as a senior software engineer, having established my own company and launched products like Sass and related technologies. Furthermore, I anticipate an expanded online presence on platforms like Instagram, where you can follow my professional journey.
